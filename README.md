# Peanut Butter and Jelly, and Overview

A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, the quintessential, love it or hate it staple of American childhood lunches, is a culture icon. But where did it come from, and what is it really?


In 1901, Julia Davis Chandler wrote in [_The Boston Cooking School Magazine of  of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics_](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015036669904&view=1up&seq=200&q1=peanut):

> For variety, some day try making little sandwiches, or bread fingers, of three very thin layers of bread and two of fill- ing, one of peanut; paste, whatever brand you prefer, and currant or crab-apple jelly for the other. The combination is delicious, and, so far as I know, original.

### Peanut and Other Butters
Peanut butter is not the only type of "butter" you can use:

| Type of Butter | Yumminess Ranking | Comments |
|:-|:-:|-|
| Peanut Butter  | 8 | Traditional, but peanuts are a common allergy. |
| Sunflower Seed Butter  | 7.5 | Nut-free butter avoids most allergies. |
| Cashew Butter  | 8.5 | Cashew butter is more expensive than peanut butter, but cashews can also be more delicious than peanuts. |
| Almond Butter  | 6 | Traditional, but peanuts are a common allergy. |
| Hazelnut and Chocolate Butter  | 10 | Nutella can be used instead of or in addition to the traditional peanut butter. |
| Butter  | 3 | Toast with butter and jam is a warm, deconstructed PBJ sandwich with dairy substituted for peanuts. |
