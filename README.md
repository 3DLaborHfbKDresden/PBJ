# Peanut Butter and Jelly

This repository was originally created for use in connection with the 2022 AMIA LIEAF workshop on [Creating Open Source Informatics Instructional Resources](https://github.com/arcus/LIEAF2022_workshop/tree/joy-github).

In the course of the workshop we will learn how to use text editing to transform a [basic text file](PBJ_text.txt) first into a [markdown file](PBJ_markdown.md) and then adding some additional functionality to create a [markdown file](PBJ_liascript.md) intended to be rendered in [LiaScript](liascript.github.io).

An overview of the topics covered in this workshop can be found in the [agenda.md](agenda.md) file, or viewed as a [LiaScript course](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcus/PBJ/main/agenda.md#1)
